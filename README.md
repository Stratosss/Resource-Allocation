# Interactive Field Coverage Mapping Tool
A Python-based interactive mapping tool developed to visualize engineersâ€™ home locations and coverage areas, inspired by a gap identified in my current role where no such solution existed. It includes configurable radius zones, account overlays, and interactive team layers to support data-driven decisions on recruitment, resource allocation, and service coverage. Built with folium, pandas, and openpyxl, geopy and pgeocode the tool enhances operational visibility and helps managers identify geographical service gaps and optimize field support.
Finally the tool pulls data from excel files, downloaded from a CRM Salesforce database.
